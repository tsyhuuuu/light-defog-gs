# LightDefogGS: Lightweight 3D Fog Removal through Gaussian Splatting and Gradient-Boosted Filtering

## 🧩 Overview
This project focuses on **3D fog removal** by leveraging **LightGBM** to classify fog-related Gaussians within **Gaussian Splat representations**.  
By distinguishing between fog and non-fog Gaussians, we achieve effective restoration of 3D scenes affected by fog.  

Our method integrates machine learning with 3D scene representation, providing a novel and efficient approach for atmospheric artifact removal in computer vision and graphics applications.

## 🚀 Methodology
1. **Gaussian Splatting** is used to represent the 3D scene.  
2. **LightGBM** is trained to classify Gaussians as **fog** or **non-fog** based on their spatial and radiometric features.  
3. The classified fog Gaussians are removed or corrected to reconstruct a clear 3D visualization.
